That's your chance to explain why you think you're a good fit, and when hiring managers are giving resumes 30 seconds to 1 minute tops, we might miss something.\n\nI really appreciate that you actually take the time to read them, but I want to point out that this is rare and becoming rarer. The general advice now is to save the \"custom cover letter\" (unless explicitly asked for in the posting) and use that time for personalized outreach to the recruiter or hiring manager. You'll get more attention and more likely that it's actually read.\n\nWhat typically happens to a cover letter is that it never gets touched, opened, or read. The recruiter/sourcing person might glance at it after reading your resume (if they already like your resume), the hiring manager might glance at it before an interview (after you've already booked the interview), and the rest of the team is unlikely to see it unless whoever is setting up the interviews happens to attach it the the meeting invitation (with almost never happens).\n\nBut what it doesn't seem to do is get you more interviews - at least not compared to other things you could do. The time would be better spent on direct outreach and trying to connect with someone.

Also most important culture of team, company and temperament of manager is unsaid. On candidate side since they know very little of exact situation they are walking in they make their applications very clinical showing standard words of emotion like passionate, high standards etc to get some brownie points and often will also add some skill to match that they actually don’t have. In my view, the JD can specify only 50- 60% of situation, so keep not more than 3 rounds of meeting with candidate who are shortlisted, be very specific on going criteria for each stage and have revenue panel to eliminate any bias. On candidate side, give you best possible objective representation and focus more on showcasing your work done in past relevant to new ask.

It’s so difficult to sift 100+ applications and come back with a pile of the truly 5-10 “best” candidates; there’s so much noise and you still have your regular responsibilities to worry about.\n\nSo now on the applicant side, I am doing my best to keep my marketer hat on when applying to marketing roles. The job listing is the brief. It has mandatories. It tells me something about the audience’s current belief. It tells me something about key massages and reasons to believe. My resume is gonna look like most everybody else’s at a quick glance, so how can I stop the scroll and get them to *really* read it? How can I make my pitch for why I’m actually a top applicant? To me, that’s what the cover letter is for.\n\nThe resume has proof points that can back up or round out the story in the cover letter, but if I just play the volume game and apply to 20 jobs a day without addressing what’s in the JD, what are the odds I’m going to wind up somewhere that understands my value? I know I’m taking a risk applying to fewer jobs, because it takes a lot of time to think through a listing, select keywords and an approach,experiment with catchy subheads, etc., but if any industry should notice and appreciate the extra legwork, it should be marketing.\n\nHow a person applies is telling you something about how they’re going to be as an employee.

According to many online threads and subreddits, average interview response rate is somewhere between 3-5%. Mine was higher I was closer to 8-10%. But even for me that's 100 applications to hear back from 10 companies (first round nothing guaranteed beyond that). It takes a lot of time to apply to 100 jobs if you're doing it yourself and not using AI to spam job applications. Most people that are looking aren't working and would like to change that as quickly as possible, but more times than not, it is taking people over a year to find a job. So if I have to apply to literally hundreds of postings to even get a shot you can imagine why many people may skim the job posting, they have to play the numbers game.  You may be thinking maybe if they read the postings more closely they'd get jobs quicker, but a vast majority of listings are pretty up front about what they want.\n\nAll this to say if you want people to include a cover letter, put it on the listing prominently, so most people will do it.

Sometimes they'll help rush book you for appointments or give you coupons + switch to more generic brands for your medications to help you out. Always worth asking.\n2. **Save examples of your work:** if you haven't been locked out of everything yet (and you're not breaking any NDA's and rules), start downloading and putting things into a Google drive. Templates you used, tutorials, examples, etc. You can always redact information later if needed, but you can't go back and get it. This also includes a copy of your severance contract (if you were given one).\n3. **Ask for letters of recommendation / references:** immediately ask managers or directors if they'd be okay providing a recommendation. Some job postings I've seen directly ask for an uploaded letter of recommendation; others will ask for their contact information. Best to ask when you're top of mind with a good relationship so you can confidently list them on any and all your applications.\n4. **Know an employment gap won't destroy you:** this layoff was both my first layoff and also my first big kid job. I was super worried everything I worked for fell apart or was for nothing, but I talked to a lot of industry mentors and they said gaps in employment can always be explained (especially given these crazy times). They advised that I take the time to travel, do side projects, learn new skills. Anything that I didn't have the time for before and might not be able to do when I'm older.\n5. **It's not your fault:** I think that's the most important thing to remember. This is all beyond us as just agency employees. You could have taken a different role at a different agency, but next week you might see layoffs there too. We can't control it and we'll never know if we truly would have been better somewhere else, only that we have to try and steer ourselves to somewhere better in the future.\n\nI'm still on the job hunt myself, so sending a lot of good energy to those impacted today and potentially impacted in the future.", "likes_or_score": 16, "reply_count": 1, "creator_heart_or_awards": 0, "author_cred_proxy": 0, "author": "Cerullie", "source_url": "https://reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/1pbwvai/advice_to_folks_who_got_laid_off/"}

Principle and adhering to your beliefs is priceless and worth more than cash. A superpower. \n\nAs someone who is in a similar situation (300k in 6 months- D2D sales) in life there will always be a trade off, and for yourself you have to decide what you’re willing to trade. \n\nThe Entrepreneurial lifestyle is selective and it takes a specific set of core values to choose it- there’s got to be a tremendous “why” and then a 1000 gallon tub of “whys” after that to keep you going. You’ve also got to determine what the exit looks like, and when to say when. Various bench marks along the way and awareness to play improv when the unseen appears.\n\nAll the feelings- negative and positive- exist in every arena. The ones specific to an entrepreneur are more potent since you, partners and your loved ones are the ones bearing it. \n\nIf I could help in anyway, I’d put yourself ahead 5 years from now. If you believe in what you’re doing- take out the money- how much do you really believe? If what you were doing paid nothing, would you still do it? If you would, that’s a sign you’re in the correct path. \n\nThe lifestyle change is only rough if you want it to be- I lived next to poverty for 4-5 years before I hit a break through.

Every so often I would sit in front  of the screens and think to myself what would be if I had my own company..\n\nOne day I was at the office and said fuck it, gave my two weeks, and left. After that went to school to get the licenses it took 9 months. Once the company started operating it was just go go go, spend money to earn money.

What really sucks is that I’m essentially financing projects out of pocket, to then wait and suck up for stuff that wasn’t part of the deal so I please the clients to not only get my money back, but to get paid.\n\nAnyway the image change and ego is what I think stops me from going all in. Going from fancy offices, travelling, spending thousands at restaurants to now always surviving. I essentially have one foot in this new career and the other still in finance, every so often I think of going back. To this day I haven’t updated my LinkedIn since leaving finance because there’s something I feel embarrassed about. \n\nThe entrepreneurial life is hard, depending of your resources and how you approach it. I had to bootstrap it, and doing much more work in different fields now. The testing part is hard, the client acquisition is hard, managing people especially hard headed construction guys is hard, bitchy and demanding clients.

But it's basically how AI is being...mmm...\"marketed\" top down.\n\nWe have Copilot at work.  It was tried briefly to determine what value it had in various functions.  Basically the result was it was a wash.  With or without, the outcomes were basically the same.  You could use it and get something of value, but there were generally trade-offs elsewhere that just ate up any value earned.\n\nWe've also used ChatGPT and a couple others.  We even used AI during out website refresh.  But realistically all that was really doing for us was bypassing costs of looking for and paying for some stock background photos by generating whatever looked good enough to use.  \n\nWe used ChatGPT for some data conversion work, basically having it do some busy work that would just take a little longer to do in Excel.  The specific task was going to be slightly labor intensive and didn't have a formula based pathway.  Basically, we have a lot of part descriptions, and we wanted to abbreviate words and descriptions across several thousand parts and descriptions.  It's not an easy task for Excel or humans to walk through, but AI could quickly suggest keyword abbreviations, and we could review that set, tweak, and use.  Frankly, over the two years we've toyed with AI in various ways, this has been the only task we've ever had it do that was a legitimate win for AI.  It was the only place I felt AI had legitimate value over anything else.  And that's only because it was \"smart\" enough to take plain text prompts and perform actions, something we don't really have outside of AI.  And these actions were specific enough where they were both simple enough but also difficult enough to do by hand.  Still, it also failed 4 times in a row before actually working properly.  It's first output was it just repeating one word that didn't even exist in the text given several thousand times.  That was its first deliverable, lol.  The next two weren't great either.  The fourth finally output basically what we wanted and could at least use as a baseline.  We still did everything else ourselves.  The value of AI started at that specific task and ended there too.\n\nOur biggest take away has been how exceptionally little AI is actually useful for.  It has such a narrow bandwidth when it's used natively outside of a robust software package.  AI alone is a really niche product.  It \"seems\" broad use on the surface and people try, oh do people try, but its core efficient competency is laser beam focused on very key tasks that are very labor intensive for humans.  For everything else, we just find there's other software and processes that are faster and easier.\n\nI feel AI has power.  But I feel that power is mostly on the backend of really good, robust, and well developed enterprise software.  You still want powerful tools tailored well for the core processes in business and operations but AI isn't built for that.  It can however support that work flow in the background.  I feel this is where AI has missed the market.  People simply want AI alone to just kind of replace and do everything.  It's not for that.  It's best used as an engine under the hood of a machine that's actually correctly built for the processes.  Big, robust software, AI underneath doing some key lifting that it's well suited for.  Do that, and you can get a better program.  It's just that everyone kind of went in reverse, threw away the idea of making enterprise software, fired a pile of people, and now are betting heavy on and relying heavily on AI to just...work...magically...somehow.  You sold the horse and threw the cart off the cliff yourself.  It's all backwards, and I don't know how long it will take before that's realized.\n\nA secondary thing is a major problem that AI will have to overcome in the following years: sentiment.  There's already AI distaste, and the heavy shoving of AI into everything and upon everyone worsens this.  We're running into an issue where AI anything is both disliked and not trusted, and it's mainly due to the above cart before the horse approach.  AI is really good...when implemented correctly.  AI is a great support system, but it's a system that needs a big, robust software package over it to really do great and wield that power efficiently.  And because it was done backwards, used improperly, and so force, we will get a pretty large split of populous that likes or hates AI, and now you have to somehow regain buy in into something that a big swath of the population despises and doesn't trust.  First impressions are important.  As this matures, I do wonder how strong the divide stays and how challenging it will be to attempt to develop and then sell a much better, mature, and competent product where AI implementation is actually really good.

And connect people.\n\nAnd then create a team to help them do whatever they've started a year or two later, because it WILL be too much for one person, but all of it will be valuable, and with a heavy focus on pragmatic solutions, connections and change management on all their products.\n\nAnd this is where I am now.

I've seen snippets of people trying to get a more \"desktop-like\" experience from their iPhones, but this takes it to a whole new level, especially with the external monitor setup. The idea of the iPhone 17 Pro Max being an \"insane pocket computer\" isn't an exaggeration – the hardware Apple packs into those things is often way more powerful than what the software officially lets us unlock.\n\nIt makes total sense why Apple would gate features like this, even if it's frustrating for users who want to push the limits. The whole \"don't hurt Mac sales\" argument is spot on. If an iPhone could truly mimic an iPad Pro's multitasking and external display capabilities, it would definitely cannibalize some of their other product lines. It's a classic example of hardware being ahead of what the company wants to enable in software for business reasons.\n\nThanks for sharing the write-up and the links too!

The same thing goes for photos, some consumers just need the white background image with no noise, other people really need to see it on a person.

By forcefully removing interests and other targeting metrics meta is now forced to take extra steps to see what kinds of people to target your ad to (which ends up in charging the advertiser more money). \n\nThey could very easily keep targeting, train the pixel on that small set of data, and compare that with lookalike audiences to spread out the ad to other people. But with their new broad targeting mindset they now for each campaign have to start from absolute zero.\n\nIt’s like telling an agency you want to run ads in a magazine but the agency telling you you’re not allowed to tell it which magazine and then forcing you to spend a bunch of money on ads that you know won’t move your product, then the agency telling you “we need to figure out who your audience is for your men’s aftershave and so we need to advertise to EVERYONE possible before we can decide who to focus on. There might be some grandmothers who want to buy aftershave for their grandkids and we don’t want to miss out on those sales. Surely you can agree this is the best approach possible.” \n\nHow is this any better? Meta has provided no real, solid, evidence-backed answers for this other than “trust us”. ", "likes_or_score": 3, "reply_count": 2, "creator_heart_or_awards": 0, "author_cred_proxy": 0, "author": "guysmiley98765", "source_url": "https://reddit.com/r/DigitalMarketing/comments/1p7qq9c/facebook_stopped_caring_about_your_targeting_two/"}
