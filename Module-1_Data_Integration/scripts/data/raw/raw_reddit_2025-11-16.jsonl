Depending on what niche you want to go in, post content in that direction. You can also use \"ugc\" in your username so brands now that you work as a ugc creator. I started posting vlogs, routines, etc. and after a few weeks beauty and lifestyle brands started to contact me. \n\n2. To build my portfolio I accepted a few barter deals in the beginning, then started to take money. Ask for testimonials from the brands after working with them. \n\n3. Learn how to create good content (editing, etc.) and find a way to stand out. Don‘t just copy other people.\n\n4. Put your email in your bio. When I worked in Creative Management and scouted UGC creators for brands I looked at 100 profiles a day. It needs to be super easy to contact you, if you want to secure brand deals, because we won‘t go out of our way to contact you. \n\n5. If you do have a good portfolio already, you can also reach out to brands on social media or if you have the right email, you can message them. \n\n6. Be patient. You won‘t make thousands of dollars in your first months. It takes time and practice to make a living out of it. \n\n7. Get the legal stuff right. Secure contracts with your clients, register your business/freelancing, have your finances together, learn how to write correct invoices, etc. \nAnd be prepared for people not paying (on time). \n\nThis is just whats worked best for me.

(Being able to pull endorsements, set up deals with vendors, etc.) It takes time to build those relationships, and you're often competing with people who have spent decades building those relationships. \n\nThe second is actually the most common difficulty I hear (especially since I deal with down-ballot candidates), which is that political marketing is extremely fast-paced compared to business marketing. And oftentimes it is just you wearing multiple hats, like IT, communications, and marketing. Also, where in business marketing you have weeks at minimum to create a comprehensive marketing strategy and longer to spend implementing said strategy, in politics you have mere days for something you are expecting, and only hours to plan and start executing a strategy for something you're not expecting (like an unknown controversy or some new information you weren't expecting). For example, as a general rule, you want to be addressing controversy that involves your client within 6 hours of the controversy breaking. And that typically includes very comprehensive plans like using surrogates of the campaign, prepping and sending talking points, updating existing strategy to work around it, preparing mass texts and emails, collecting data, monitoring social media, etc., all while maybe or maybe not dealing with the press. ", "likes_or_score": 2, "reply_count": 0, "creator_heart_or_awards": 0, "author_cred_proxy": 0, "author": "Clayton4NC", "source_url": "https://reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/1ogpohq/who_is_making_the_ice_ads/"}

But that part is very much up to the pros who wield the new tools. \n\nIt’s a lot like CGI in movies. It was used to very shitty effect in the early days-/Spider-Man 3 was essentially a cartoon movie because of its over-reliant and crude use of CGI, rendering it almost unwatchable today. But it’s has gotten so much better because the craft has gotten better—personally I love the Lord of The Rings movies and can watch the over and over. CGI made the making of those books into movies possible. That Peter Jackson and team applied the technology w so much craft is something I’m endlessly grateful for as a fan. CGI helped them match my mind’s eye expectation—which, WOW!\n\nI think AI will go through the same curve. Shitty and  ham-fisted application at first, settling into a much better, more artful and effective style eventually. \n\nAs I see it, you’ve got a chance to usher in that second wave of AI excellence as quickly as possible. If I were you, that’s how I’d view my assignment. That’s something to aim for, something to be creatively proud of. A significant career achievement.\n\n(And also, when the choices are 1.

In some cases, the addresses posted by the hackers appear to relate to residential addresses rather than offices. \n\nIt is not clear how the hackers collated or otherwise sourced this data, be that by combining previous diffuse data breaches, or by obtaining it from a government-specific breach.\n\nDHS has repeatedly said that its officers are facing a wave of doxing and physical threats in the second Trump administration. Most recently the agency said officials “are facing a more than 1000% increase in assaults against them and their families are being doxxed and threatened online.” It is not clear how exactly DHS is quantifying those events to calculate that increase. \n\nThe U.S. government has taken action against apps, websites, and social media pages it claims are doxing or otherwise threatening DHS and ICE officials. In many cases, those apps were participating in First Amendment protected speech and were not doxing officials. Apple, for example, removed one app called Eyes Up that was aggregating videos of ICE activity and abuses. Apple banned a wave of apps after direct pressure from the Department of Justice. \n\nThese apps also gained popularity after masked ICE agents who refused to identify themselves repeatedly raided communities of immigrants and picked people off the street often without explanation. Recently ICE’s activity has included shooting a priest in the head with a projectile; flooding Chicago neighborhoods with chemical irritants; and detaining and threatening U.S. citizens.\n\nThe data dump by Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters is more clearly an attempt at a mass doxing event.\n\nThe hacking group that posted the dox emerged from the Com, short for community. On Discord servers and Telegram channels, thousands of fraudsters, scammers, hackers, and gamers carry out hacks, beef with one another, and commission physical violence. A number of loose-knit groups have emerged from that community, including Scattered Spider which was responsible for the massive ransomware attack against MGM Resorts, and LAPSUS$ which was responsible for a wave of extortions against gaming companies, including Electronic Arts.\n\nThe name Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters is an amalgamation of several of those names. This iteration gained notoriety recently after threatening to publish a wealth of data related to Salesforce customers, including Disney/Hulu, FedEx, Toyota, UPS, and more. \n\nIn 2016, another hacking group called Crackas With Attitude posted the personal information of around 20,000 FBI agents and 9,000 DHS officials.\n\nNeither the DHS, FBI, or Department of Justice responded to requests for comment.\n\n“U guys want IRS next?” the hackers wrote in another message.", "likes_or_score": 2303, "reply_count": 23, "creator_heart_or_awards": 0, "author_cred_proxy": 0, "author": "chrisdh79", "source_url": "https://reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1o90vcf/hackers_dox_hundreds_of_dhs_ice_fbi_and_doj/"}

They’re all repeating what the U.S. government said.\n\nFor example, El Financiero’s article literally bases the whole thing on what DHS and Kristi Noem claimed, and it references the arrest of one dude from the Latin Kings who supposedly offered money for info on a Border Patrol agent. There’s no solid proof that cartels themselves are organizing or paying for this — just that U.S. officials are making that claim.\n\nSo right now, it kinda feels like more political narrative than confirmed fact.

One trying to make good on a promise Valve made a long time ago.\n\nWith prototype Steam Machines heading out to reviewers back in 2013, us included, the company had grand plans of reinventing what constitutes a gaming PC around its new creation, a Linux-based operating system called SteamOS. Years on, and following a few failed partner launches that you can read all about in our retrospective of their demise, the project was more or less doomed. By 2018, Valve pulled the plug.\n\nOr did it? Valve never stopped working on SteamOS, plugging away until it landed on the successful formula launched inside the Steam Deck in 2022. Following this success, Valve feels ready to take a second punt at a system with more firepower.\n\n\"We finally have all the software and the hardware bits to make the original vision a reality,\" Yazan Aldehayyat, a Valve engineer working on the Steam Machine, says during my visit to Valve HQ. They mention it's the right time because users are already making Steam Machines happen, putting a recovery image of SteamOS onto a range of devices or using their Steam Deck while docked.\n\nThe Steam Machine will be released at some point in 2026. We don't know pricing yet, but with older, mid-range components and Valve's own success with the budget-friendly Steam Deck, I'm hopeful for a convincing price tag here. There's a big gap in the market for a genuinely affordable gaming PC, and I'm hoping this is the machine to plug it.\n\nPlus, the smaller 512 GB option should be a decent amount cheaper than the 2 TB model.", "likes_or_score": 994, "reply_count": 8, "creator_heart_or_awards": 0, "author_cred_proxy": 0, "author": "chrisdh79", "source_url": "https://reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1ovcp49/valves_new_steam_machine_is_a_steamospowered_mini/"}

I worked for an amusement vendor, so I saw the numbers of what came in and what went out.\n\nWhen the games were 50 cents each, some of the more popular bars would have 300-400 a month in them.

After it went to $1 a game it probably pulled back to $200 a month on a good month. \n\nThe owner shrugged and said well.... the cloth will last longer so it's a wash.

Cost us less than $100 in material and he lost $50 to $100 a month out of his end. \n\nI over heard another vendor talking about it... I casually mention I'd go back to 50 cents as you'd make more money. We get to talking through it. Less than a month later that vendor moves their tables all back to 50 cents. And I was 100% right. Their sales recovered and then some (since they're now the cheapest tables to play on). \n\nI 100% told the owner of vendor I worked for to do this a few months prior.

It depends on the complexity of the application.\n\nHere's what typically happens. Founders want an MVP built fast and cheap to prove POC and not waste money if the concept does not pan out. The proof of concept generates interest, the non-technical founders think great and start making sales.\n\nThe problem is the application was never built in a way that's maintainable or scalable, it was build fast and cheap held together by shoe strings. To support the first few clients, attract potential new clients, cofounders ask to implement new features and small fixes on top of the MVP that was not built in a way to be scaled, so what happens is you end up building shit on top of shit with the promise we'll definitely fix it later, but in reality that later never comes.\n\nEventually, the mess becomes so big that maintaining and scaling, implementing new features becomes very time-consuming, costly and buggy. And you're in too deep and no one wants to spend the money on time to fix it all properly.\n\nThat's usually the typical approach from non-technical founders.\n\nIf you're non-technical and you're building your MVP with AI, It's almost certain that it's not going to be maintainable and scalable with out a professional developer.\n\nMy advice is, If you build the MVP and you find that there's a market and you don't want to lose any potential customers, you can in theory take those customers and take the risk of that maybe your MVP wont be buggy abd drive then away, but just make damn sure that you don't start adding any new fearures or complexity until you can find a proper development team that can rebuild your MVP and get it stable. \n\nDo not fall into the trap of thinking, oh I'll just add this little bit here, this little bit there and then we'll fix it properly later. Another tip do not just start adding new at the request of one customer as soon as they ask for something.\n\nA lot of users only use 20% of the application. Put your core focus and energy into the 20%, and worry about the 80% later.\n\nBut most importantly, if you don't start from a good foundation i.e stable application, you will end up paying for it later.", "likes_or_score": 1, "reply_count": 0, "creator_heart_or_awards": 0, "author_cred_proxy": 0, "author": "Bezzzzo", "source_url": "https://reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1oex6aw/true_story_nontechnical_founder_tried_to_sell_a/"}

I'd also say the environment is incredibly valuable, if everyone around you is very high-achieving, it's far easier to motivate yourself to do the same. \n\nIf your classmates are startup founders, have connections in VC or parents who founded successful companies, you have a huge leg up over people who don't have that.

They charge DDU parcels charges before it leaves the original country so any rejections are not such a pain. However its 2x as long as an equivalent postal service, while only 20-30% cheaper.\n\nThat said, postal services are very all over the place with how they charge customs.
