I have written hundreds of cover letters and responded skill based application questions and have received no response from the hiring team over the past few months.

That's your chance to explain why you think you're a good fit, and when hiring managers are giving resumes 30 seconds to 1 minute tops, we might miss something.\n\nI really appreciate that you actually take the time to read them, but I want to point out that this is rare and becoming rarer. The general advice now is to save the \"custom cover letter\" (unless explicitly asked for in the posting) and use that time for personalized outreach to the recruiter or hiring manager. You'll get more attention and more likely that it's actually read.\n\nWhat typically happens to a cover letter is that it never gets touched, opened, or read. The recruiter/sourcing person might glance at it after reading your resume (if they already like your resume), the hiring manager might glance at it before an interview (after you've already booked the interview), and the rest of the team is unlikely to see it unless whoever is setting up the interviews happens to attach it the the meeting invitation (with almost never happens).\n\nBut what it doesn't seem to do is get you more interviews - at least not compared to other things you could do. The time would be better spent on direct outreach and trying to connect with someone.

Also most important culture of team, company and temperament of manager is unsaid. On candidate side since they know very little of exact situation they are walking in they make their applications very clinical showing standard words of emotion like passionate, high standards etc to get some brownie points and often will also add some skill to match that they actually don’t have. In my view, the JD can specify only 50- 60% of situation, so keep not more than 3 rounds of meeting with candidate who are shortlisted, be very specific on going criteria for each stage and have revenue panel to eliminate any bias. On candidate side, give you best possible objective representation and focus more on showcasing your work done in past relevant to new ask.

It’s so difficult to sift 100+ applications and come back with a pile of the truly 5-10 “best” candidates; there’s so much noise and you still have your regular responsibilities to worry about.\n\nSo now on the applicant side, I am doing my best to keep my marketer hat on when applying to marketing roles. The job listing is the brief. It has mandatories. It tells me something about the audience’s current belief. It tells me something about key massages and reasons to believe. My resume is gonna look like most everybody else’s at a quick glance, so how can I stop the scroll and get them to *really* read it? How can I make my pitch for why I’m actually a top applicant? To me, that’s what the cover letter is for.\n\nThe resume has proof points that can back up or round out the story in the cover letter, but if I just play the volume game and apply to 20 jobs a day without addressing what’s in the JD, what are the odds I’m going to wind up somewhere that understands my value? I know I’m taking a risk applying to fewer jobs, because it takes a lot of time to think through a listing, select keywords and an approach,experiment with catchy subheads, etc., but if any industry should notice and appreciate the extra legwork, it should be marketing.\n\nHow a person applies is telling you something about how they’re going to be as an employee.

According to many online threads and subreddits, average interview response rate is somewhere between 3-5%. Mine was higher I was closer to 8-10%. But even for me that's 100 applications to hear back from 10 companies (first round nothing guaranteed beyond that). It takes a lot of time to apply to 100 jobs if you're doing it yourself and not using AI to spam job applications. Most people that are looking aren't working and would like to change that as quickly as possible, but more times than not, it is taking people over a year to find a job. So if I have to apply to literally hundreds of postings to even get a shot you can imagine why many people may skim the job posting, they have to play the numbers game.  You may be thinking maybe if they read the postings more closely they'd get jobs quicker, but a vast majority of listings are pretty up front about what they want.\n\nAll this to say if you want people to include a cover letter, put it on the listing prominently, so most people will do it.

Sometimes they'll help rush book you for appointments or give you coupons + switch to more generic brands for your medications to help you out. Always worth asking.\n2. **Save examples of your work:** if you haven't been locked out of everything yet (and you're not breaking any NDA's and rules), start downloading and putting things into a Google drive. Templates you used, tutorials, examples, etc. You can always redact information later if needed, but you can't go back and get it. This also includes a copy of your severance contract (if you were given one).\n3. **Ask for letters of recommendation / references:** immediately ask managers or directors if they'd be okay providing a recommendation. Some job postings I've seen directly ask for an uploaded letter of recommendation; others will ask for their contact information. Best to ask when you're top of mind with a good relationship so you can confidently list them on any and all your applications.\n4. **Know an employment gap won't destroy you:** this layoff was both my first layoff and also my first big kid job. I was super worried everything I worked for fell apart or was for nothing, but I talked to a lot of industry mentors and they said gaps in employment can always be explained (especially given these crazy times). They advised that I take the time to travel, do side projects, learn new skills. Anything that I didn't have the time for before and might not be able to do when I'm older.\n5. **It's not your fault:** I think that's the most important thing to remember. This is all beyond us as just agency employees. You could have taken a different role at a different agency, but next week you might see layoffs there too. We can't control it and we'll never know if we truly would have been better somewhere else, only that we have to try and steer ourselves to somewhere better in the future.\n\nI'm still on the job hunt myself, so sending a lot of good energy to those impacted today and potentially impacted in the future.", "likes_or_score": 15, "reply_count": 1, "creator_heart_or_awards": 0, "author_cred_proxy": 0, "author": "Cerullie", "source_url": "https://reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/1pbwvai/advice_to_folks_who_got_laid_off/"}

One trying to make good on a promise Valve made a long time ago.\n\nWith prototype Steam Machines heading out to reviewers back in 2013, us included, the company had grand plans of reinventing what constitutes a gaming PC around its new creation, a Linux-based operating system called SteamOS. Years on, and following a few failed partner launches that you can read all about in our retrospective of their demise, the project was more or less doomed. By 2018, Valve pulled the plug.\n\nOr did it? Valve never stopped working on SteamOS, plugging away until it landed on the successful formula launched inside the Steam Deck in 2022. Following this success, Valve feels ready to take a second punt at a system with more firepower.\n\n\"We finally have all the software and the hardware bits to make the original vision a reality,\" Yazan Aldehayyat, a Valve engineer working on the Steam Machine, says during my visit to Valve HQ. They mention it's the right time because users are already making Steam Machines happen, putting a recovery image of SteamOS onto a range of devices or using their Steam Deck while docked.\n\nThe Steam Machine will be released at some point in 2026. We don't know pricing yet, but with older, mid-range components and Valve's own success with the budget-friendly Steam Deck, I'm hopeful for a convincing price tag here. There's a big gap in the market for a genuinely affordable gaming PC, and I'm hoping this is the machine to plug it.\n\nPlus, the smaller 512 GB option should be a decent amount cheaper than the 2 TB model.", "likes_or_score": 1004, "reply_count": 6, "creator_heart_or_awards": 0, "author_cred_proxy": 0, "author": "chrisdh79", "source_url": "https://reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1ovcp49/valves_new_steam_machine_is_a_steamospowered_mini/"}

Hell, these hybrid console/PC systems are probably the next step in gaming for the mainstream.

And it's a toss up, is sales a more important skill, or is technical a more important skill.\n\nIt's kind of a catch-22. When sales people run companies they are able to go and sell investors, and get the money. But they don't know how to deliver.\n\nFor example, Elizabeth Holmes. She was able to go and raise the money. The product didn't work and now she's in jail.\n\nWhen technical people run the company, they can build a great product, and it can be sometimes hard to sell.\n\nThe biggest problem for technical people is getting out of speaking technical language and speaking the language of your audience.\n\nExecutives are speaking in a different high level jargon. A blue collar tradesperson is speaking a different language.\n\nGetting onto the wavelength of your customer requires a different set of emotional intelligence skills.\n\nHowever, what I've found is when you are onto something, selling becomes a heck of a lot easier. When you know who your customer is, suddenly they are listening on the end of the line, and willing to give you their time.\n\nWhen you are after the wrong customer, you are finding it hard to keep the person on the other line interested.\n\nWith that in mind, take a look at the pitch for my company (I have my sales hat on right now):\n\n[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fan-\\_3yDkIaTVCYIqRvXXNKcemRkrEzZ/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112021489972476333242&rtpof=true&sd=true](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fan-_3yDkIaTVCYIqRvXXNKcemRkrEzZ/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112021489972476333242&rtpof=true&sd=true)", "likes_or_score": 1, "reply_count": 0, "creator_heart_or_awards": 0, "author_cred_proxy": 0, "author": "DryAlternative1132", "source_url": "https://reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1pbqs27/advice_from_a_9figure_entrepreneur/"}

My business has exploded in the last 3 months. I went from making $5k a month to making nearly $40k last month. It's affiliate marketing so I guess you could consider it self employment. I'm 20 years old so this has been pretty life changing for me. However I am signed up to go on a Semester at Sea, which is truly a once in a lifetime experience. On top of that I got nearly a full ride scholarship. I signed up when I was making $5k a month from the business and I was OK leaving that behind. I know I can scale more and I literally get to make that money from the comfort of my own home around the people I love. Now I am not sure if I can leave that behind, I'd have to rebuild when I get back which could be quick or take a long time. I have no way of knowing. It's a short term business that will probably last a few more years before I have to pivot into something else. Also if I went it'd be during Q1, so sales may be slightly lower but I'm confident I can maintain $20k-$40k every month.\n\nI've been trying to decide for 2 months and can't get myself to do it. I know going on the trip would be incredibly beneficial for me, but staying back could set up my future to a point where I'm confident I could retire very early, like 30 years old. If money wasn't in the equation I would obviously push myself to go. There is no way I could run the business while abroad, or have someone else successfully run it for me. Is staying back a mistake? Everyone says SAS was the best experience of their entire lives and that they'd trade all their money to go back. However I feel like I may be in a different situation. Traveling for me is 80% about the people and 20% about the location, so going solo on another trip probably wouldn't appeal to me as much.

Here's the honest answer: I'm looking to launch a charitable foundation in January, as well as a sort of \"companion book\" that explains what the foundation is all about. I asked Claude for some ideas on pre-marketing my book, and it recommended using Reddit (especially CMV) to test my ideas, build an audience, etc. I came on here to do that and realized I can't post anywhere with 3 karma (which is the number I was at 24 hours ago) -- yet another \"little wall\" that you have to overcome when you're starting something new.

I've seen snippets of people trying to get a more \"desktop-like\" experience from their iPhones, but this takes it to a whole new level, especially with the external monitor setup. The idea of the iPhone 17 Pro Max being an \"insane pocket computer\" isn't an exaggeration – the hardware Apple packs into those things is often way more powerful than what the software officially lets us unlock.\n\nIt makes total sense why Apple would gate features like this, even if it's frustrating for users who want to push the limits. The whole \"don't hurt Mac sales\" argument is spot on. If an iPhone could truly mimic an iPad Pro's multitasking and external display capabilities, it would definitely cannibalize some of their other product lines. It's a classic example of hardware being ahead of what the company wants to enable in software for business reasons.\n\nThanks for sharing the write-up and the links too!

There is already a requirement to enable developer options, enable installation of software from unknown sources (which presents a warning), and then open the APK file using a permitted app, such as a file explorer or Downloads app (which requires another series of steps to permit that app to install other apps, when done the first time). If the new flow doesn't significantly differ, in a way that users aren't already likely to ignore, then this is just Google performing theater. Users need to be coached proactively to utterly and completely ignore people on the phone telling them to act urgently in ways that they don't understand. They don't need more ineffective warnings.\n\nThe rest of the blogpost is utter nonsense, too. Signing an app doesn't mean it's secure, it just means the signer is okay with the app; they've literally just given it their seal of approval. Google has approved/signed the myriad adversarial apps that already exist on the Play Store, so are they okay with those existing? And why do they continue to approve new ones and updates to existing ones?

I could imagine a situation where people have the steam machine or steam deck dual boot.\n\nI firmly stand behind linux not allowing crap in ring 0 (crap being anything other than the os bits that make the os work). Windows stupidly allows crap in ring 0. there is two rings to modern os ring 0 and ring 1. Ring 1 is where the user is logged in and their apps run. Ring 0 should be exclusivly for the bits that make the OS work. The crowdstrike issue from a couple of years back was because crowdstrike runs in ring 0 and crashed the OS. You could say linux has the possibility of being more stable as an OS because Linus Torvalds (creator of linux) forbids any installed software from running in ring 0. Valve takes the extra step of having a protected operating system folder that can not be modified by the user unless its unlocked by a special command, and even then, it's not guaranteed to exist after a system update.

They can't release exact pricing because RAM prices are currently outrageous and could go up or down as the AI bubble pops or continues to grow next year. Tariffs also make an issue for the USA market. Valve makes plenty of dollars off the 30% cut they get from games sold on Steam, so they don't need dollars from the hardware. They need to sell more hardware to get more games sold.\n\nThey said they also dont expect to sell very many Steam Machines because most gamers could upgrade their existing desktop rig, and this is more for a casual user or mostly console user that doesn't build their own machines. I would expect them to prioritize the steam frame because they have to get that out to as many gamers as possible to take on meta and price similarly to meta. I actually expect the Steam framed to be priced better than meta because the frame is VR only (not sure if you heard that), but the external cameras on the frame are B&W, not color, so no passthrough and no augmented reality games with the v1 of the steam frame. Also, Valve likely isn't competing with the Quest Pro model or the Samsung Android headset as they are talking computing saving functions like eye tracking to prioritize what's rendered by the onboard hardware.\n\nThis suggest not a bleeding-edge chip. Making this more of an economy model will put it in the hands of more potential gamers, more hardware means more games made means more games sold. The chicken/egg of VR was always that it was too costly for most people to give it a chance, (forget hardware like the Apple Vision Pro) thus developers weren't willing to make full-length VR titles.", "likes_or_score": 1, "reply_count": 0, "creator_heart_or_awards": 0, "author_cred_proxy": 0, "author": "nexusx86", "source_url": "https://reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1ovgtu1/valve_is_welcoming_android_games_into_steam/"}

The same thing goes for photos, some consumers just need the white background image with no noise, other people really need to see it on a person.

By forcefully removing interests and other targeting metrics meta is now forced to take extra steps to see what kinds of people to target your ad to (which ends up in charging the advertiser more money). \n\nThey could very easily keep targeting, train the pixel on that small set of data, and compare that with lookalike audiences to spread out the ad to other people. But with their new broad targeting mindset they now for each campaign have to start from absolute zero.\n\nIt’s like telling an agency you want to run ads in a magazine but the agency telling you you’re not allowed to tell it which magazine and then forcing you to spend a bunch of money on ads that you know won’t move your product, then the agency telling you “we need to figure out who your audience is for your men’s aftershave and so we need to advertise to EVERYONE possible before we can decide who to focus on. There might be some grandmothers who want to buy aftershave for their grandkids and we don’t want to miss out on those sales. Surely you can agree this is the best approach possible.” \n\nHow is this any better?
