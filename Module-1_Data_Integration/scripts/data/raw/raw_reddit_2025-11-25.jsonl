I have written hundreds of cover letters and responded skill based application questions and have received no response from the hiring team over the past few months.

That's your chance to explain why you think you're a good fit, and when hiring managers are giving resumes 30 seconds to 1 minute tops, we might miss something.\n\nI really appreciate that you actually take the time to read them, but I want to point out that this is rare and becoming rarer. The general advice now is to save the \"custom cover letter\" (unless explicitly asked for in the posting) and use that time for personalized outreach to the recruiter or hiring manager. You'll get more attention and more likely that it's actually read.\n\nWhat typically happens to a cover letter is that it never gets touched, opened, or read. The recruiter/sourcing person might glance at it after reading your resume (if they already like your resume), the hiring manager might glance at it before an interview (after you've already booked the interview), and the rest of the team is unlikely to see it unless whoever is setting up the interviews happens to attach it the the meeting invitation (with almost never happens).\n\nBut what it doesn't seem to do is get you more interviews - at least not compared to other things you could do. The time would be better spent on direct outreach and trying to connect with someone.

Also most important culture of team, company and temperament of manager is unsaid. On candidate side since they know very little of exact situation they are walking in they make their applications very clinical showing standard words of emotion like passionate, high standards etc to get some brownie points and often will also add some skill to match that they actually don’t have. In my view, the JD can specify only 50- 60% of situation, so keep not more than 3 rounds of meeting with candidate who are shortlisted, be very specific on going criteria for each stage and have revenue panel to eliminate any bias. On candidate side, give you best possible objective representation and focus more on showcasing your work done in past relevant to new ask.

It’s so difficult to sift 100+ applications and come back with a pile of the truly 5-10 “best” candidates; there’s so much noise and you still have your regular responsibilities to worry about.\n\nSo now on the applicant side, I am doing my best to keep my marketer hat on when applying to marketing roles. The job listing is the brief. It has mandatories. It tells me something about the audience’s current belief. It tells me something about key massages and reasons to believe. My resume is gonna look like most everybody else’s at a quick glance, so how can I stop the scroll and get them to *really* read it? How can I make my pitch for why I’m actually a top applicant? To me, that’s what the cover letter is for.\n\nThe resume has proof points that can back up or round out the story in the cover letter, but if I just play the volume game and apply to 20 jobs a day without addressing what’s in the JD, what are the odds I’m going to wind up somewhere that understands my value? I know I’m taking a risk applying to fewer jobs, because it takes a lot of time to think through a listing, select keywords and an approach,experiment with catchy subheads, etc., but if any industry should notice and appreciate the extra legwork, it should be marketing.\n\nHow a person applies is telling you something about how they’re going to be as an employee. And how a company handles applicants is telling you something about how they’re going to be as an employer.

Looking for a job today is completely and totally demoralizing. \n\nYou can imagine if you're getting hundreds of resumes in days that the market is pretty grim.  According to many online threads and subreddits, average interview response rate is somewhere between 3-5%. Mine was higher I was closer to 8-10%. But even for me that's 100 applications to hear back from 10 companies (first round nothing guaranteed beyond that). It takes a lot of time to apply to 100 jobs if you're doing it yourself and not using AI to spam job applications. Most people that are looking aren't working and would like to change that as quickly as possible, but more times than not, it is taking people over a year to find a job. So if I have to apply to literally hundreds of postings to even get a shot you can imagine why many people may skim the job posting, they have to play the numbers game.  You may be thinking maybe if they read the postings more closely they'd get jobs quicker, but a vast majority of listings are pretty up front about what they want.\n\nAll this to say if you want people to include a cover letter, put it on the listing prominently, so most people will do it.

(Being able to pull endorsements, set up deals with vendors, etc.) It takes time to build those relationships, and you're often competing with people who have spent decades building those relationships. \n\nThe second is actually the most common difficulty I hear (especially since I deal with down-ballot candidates), which is that political marketing is extremely fast-paced compared to business marketing. And oftentimes it is just you wearing multiple hats, like IT, communications, and marketing. Also, where in business marketing you have weeks at minimum to create a comprehensive marketing strategy and longer to spend implementing said strategy, in politics you have mere days for something you are expecting, and only hours to plan and start executing a strategy for something you're not expecting (like an unknown controversy or some new information you weren't expecting). For example, as a general rule, you want to be addressing controversy that involves your client within 6 hours of the controversy breaking. And that typically includes very comprehensive plans like using surrogates of the campaign, prepping and sending talking points, updating existing strategy to work around it, preparing mass texts and emails, collecting data, monitoring social media, etc., all while maybe or maybe not dealing with the press. ", "likes_or_score": 2, "reply_count": 0, "creator_heart_or_awards": 0, "author_cred_proxy": 0, "author": "Clayton4NC", "source_url": "https://reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/1ogpohq/who_is_making_the_ice_ads/"}

One trying to make good on a promise Valve made a long time ago.\n\nWith prototype Steam Machines heading out to reviewers back in 2013, us included, the company had grand plans of reinventing what constitutes a gaming PC around its new creation, a Linux-based operating system called SteamOS. Years on, and following a few failed partner launches that you can read all about in our retrospective of their demise, the project was more or less doomed. By 2018, Valve pulled the plug.\n\nOr did it? Valve never stopped working on SteamOS, plugging away until it landed on the successful formula launched inside the Steam Deck in 2022. Following this success, Valve feels ready to take a second punt at a system with more firepower.\n\n\"We finally have all the software and the hardware bits to make the original vision a reality,\" Yazan Aldehayyat, a Valve engineer working on the Steam Machine, says during my visit to Valve HQ. They mention it's the right time because users are already making Steam Machines happen, putting a recovery image of SteamOS onto a range of devices or using their Steam Deck while docked.\n\nThe Steam Machine will be released at some point in 2026. We don't know pricing yet, but with older, mid-range components and Valve's own success with the budget-friendly Steam Deck, I'm hopeful for a convincing price tag here. There's a big gap in the market for a genuinely affordable gaming PC, and I'm hoping this is the machine to plug it.\n\nPlus, the smaller 512 GB option should be a decent amount cheaper than the 2 TB model.", "likes_or_score": 996, "reply_count": 6, "creator_heart_or_awards": 0, "author_cred_proxy": 0, "author": "chrisdh79", "source_url": "https://reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1ovcp49/valves_new_steam_machine_is_a_steamospowered_mini/"}

I worked for an amusement vendor, so I saw the numbers of what came in and what went out.\n\nWhen the games were 50 cents each, some of the more popular bars would have 300-400 a month in them.

I casually mention I'd go back to 50 cents as you'd make more money. We get to talking through it. Less than a month later that vendor moves their tables all back to 50 cents. And I was 100% right. Their sales recovered and then some (since they're now the cheapest tables to play on). \n\nI 100% told the owner of vendor I worked for to do this a few months prior.

There is no such thing as a person that can't deal with uncertainty, managing money or that needs constant validation - there just are people that can't do that stuff RIGHT NOW, because that's where they are, who they believe they are and who they choose to be in the future.\n\nThe key is personal growth. It sounds cliche because so many wannabe coaches preach it, but it is true. Just imagine who you were as a child. There is very little of that person in you right now. You changed. The only difference is that most of those changes happen by accident, while the most necessary changes must happen by choice.\n\nOnce you decide to change, you have to act. If you want to learn how to deal with uncertainty, well, put yourself in risky situations. Put your money in small caps, buy cripto, start a side hustle. Assess where you fuck up and learn. If you want to learn how to manage money, well, save and try to manage money. Buy courses, read books on the subject. Assess where you fuck up and learn. If you crave external validation, go to therapy and put yourself in situations in which people doubt you. Assess where you fuck up and learn. Every failure in your journey will hurt - some of them will hurt a lot. Assess the pain, learn and move on.\n\nWhere people go wrong is that they listen to their ego and unsuccessful people, let fear take over their decision rationale, fail to take ownership and responsibility and develop a flawed thought process in which they try as hard as possible to seek comfort and avoid pain. That leads to stagnation, frustration and resentment.\n\nGrowth is in failure and pain. Success is what you attain after you become the person who withstood and rose above those challenges.\n\nIn case you are wondering, this isn't some coaching bullshit. I became a much bettern partner after my first wife divorced me, I went to therapy and owned my shit. I became a better professional after 10 years of service in a company that pushed me as far as I could go. I learned how to build a business after blowing up a failed venture and going bankrupt. It all hurt like fucking hell at the time. I went through depression, substance abuse and all that jazz. I had to decide to get better. Things only got better once I put myself in the driver seat of my own life. If I did it, anyone can. I'm just a random dude from a midsized city in a third world country. ", "likes_or_score": 3, "reply_count": 0, "creator_heart_or_awards": 0, "author_cred_proxy": 0, "author": "Adorable_Release_810", "source_url": "https://reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1p04mq1/most_people_should_not_start_a_business/"}

I've had super simple companies, to complex companies. You are so so so wrong though and I'll tell you why you need to quit making these post.\n\n99.9% of businesses in America are small businesses (less than 500 people). \n\n98% of businesses in America a have less than 100 people. \n\nGiven those numbers, a safe assumption is that well over 90% of businesses have LESS than 25 people. The point I'm getting at here is, the vast majority of businesses in America are what I call \"micro\" companies. Companies that are anywhere from 5-15+ employees.\n\nSo why is it like this? The reason is very simple. Every  business, is a bunch of micro business that you could do easier and easier. **No matter what skill you have, that you use at a company, is being used as a stand alone company somewhere else.** \n\nWhat do I mean by this? Fine, you have this horrible job at a car dealership. You are a receptionist. You hate it. You want something else. \n\n**Ever heard of Concentrix? They recently did 10 BILLION in revenue by answering phones.** You know there are people, working at companies now, answering phones for less than $15 an hour. \n\nCar dealerships, clean cars, fix cars, sell cars, sell parts. ALL things you can hire people to do for you. My friends company does very well with just a window tint/detail company. Is **he going to be the next Microsoft? Probably not. BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE.** You just need to make enough money that you never have to stress about money again. \n\nEntrepreneurship is not brutal. I've never struggled because I planned and followed rules. If you don't have basic money skills, learn! The largest issue I see is people try to start too big. With too big of a vision. Lets vacuum some floors first. Lets clean some windows. Lets cut some grass. Your neighbor always complaining about how dirty the dog is? My friend Sara makes MONEY with her pet grooming company. \n\n**Most of all:**\n\nQuit telling people its hard.\n\nQuit telling people its stressful.\n\nQuit telling people they shouldn't.\n\nQuit telling people they can't do it because YOU couldn't do it. \n\nI HOPE someone on here looks at your post and says F that shit.

There's tons of other way of making money except business.

Tons of research demonstate layoffs achieves no returns and can be interpreted as weak leadership and strategy. Hence, they've lost the room with employees.
