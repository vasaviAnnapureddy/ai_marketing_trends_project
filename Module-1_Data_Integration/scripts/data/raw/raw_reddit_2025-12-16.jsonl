I have written hundreds of cover letters and responded skill based application questions and have received no response from the hiring team over the past few months.

That's your chance to explain why you think you're a good fit, and when hiring managers are giving resumes 30 seconds to 1 minute tops, we might miss something.\n\nI really appreciate that you actually take the time to read them, but I want to point out that this is rare and becoming rarer. The general advice now is to save the \"custom cover letter\" (unless explicitly asked for in the posting) and use that time for personalized outreach to the recruiter or hiring manager. You'll get more attention and more likely that it's actually read.\n\nWhat typically happens to a cover letter is that it never gets touched, opened, or read. The recruiter/sourcing person might glance at it after reading your resume (if they already like your resume), the hiring manager might glance at it before an interview (after you've already booked the interview), and the rest of the team is unlikely to see it unless whoever is setting up the interviews happens to attach it the the meeting invitation (with almost never happens).\n\nBut what it doesn't seem to do is get you more interviews - at least not compared to other things you could do. The time would be better spent on direct outreach and trying to connect with someone.

Also most important culture of team, company and temperament of manager is unsaid. On candidate side since they know very little of exact situation they are walking in they make their applications very clinical showing standard words of emotion like passionate, high standards etc to get some brownie points and often will also add some skill to match that they actually don’t have. In my view, the JD can specify only 50- 60% of situation, so keep not more than 3 rounds of meeting with candidate who are shortlisted, be very specific on going criteria for each stage and have revenue panel to eliminate any bias. On candidate side, give you best possible objective representation and focus more on showcasing your work done in past relevant to new ask.

It’s so difficult to sift 100+ applications and come back with a pile of the truly 5-10 “best” candidates; there’s so much noise and you still have your regular responsibilities to worry about.\n\nSo now on the applicant side, I am doing my best to keep my marketer hat on when applying to marketing roles. The job listing is the brief. It has mandatories. It tells me something about the audience’s current belief. It tells me something about key massages and reasons to believe. My resume is gonna look like most everybody else’s at a quick glance, so how can I stop the scroll and get them to *really* read it? How can I make my pitch for why I’m actually a top applicant? To me, that’s what the cover letter is for.\n\nThe resume has proof points that can back up or round out the story in the cover letter, but if I just play the volume game and apply to 20 jobs a day without addressing what’s in the JD, what are the odds I’m going to wind up somewhere that understands my value? I know I’m taking a risk applying to fewer jobs, because it takes a lot of time to think through a listing, select keywords and an approach,experiment with catchy subheads, etc., but if any industry should notice and appreciate the extra legwork, it should be marketing.\n\nHow a person applies is telling you something about how they’re going to be as an employee.

According to many online threads and subreddits, average interview response rate is somewhere between 3-5%. Mine was higher I was closer to 8-10%. But even for me that's 100 applications to hear back from 10 companies (first round nothing guaranteed beyond that). It takes a lot of time to apply to 100 jobs if you're doing it yourself and not using AI to spam job applications. Most people that are looking aren't working and would like to change that as quickly as possible, but more times than not, it is taking people over a year to find a job. So if I have to apply to literally hundreds of postings to even get a shot you can imagine why many people may skim the job posting, they have to play the numbers game.  You may be thinking maybe if they read the postings more closely they'd get jobs quicker, but a vast majority of listings are pretty up front about what they want.\n\nAll this to say if you want people to include a cover letter, put it on the listing prominently, so most people will do it.

This is a smart way to spark engagement with new followers (just set a 3-minute trigger delay) and then re-engage later for email sign-up. For our last campaign, we looked at Manychat DM data vs. link in bio Linktree click-through data, and Manychat had 3.5x more engagement.

Sometimes they'll help rush book you for appointments or give you coupons + switch to more generic brands for your medications to help you out. Always worth asking.\n2. **Save examples of your work:** if you haven't been locked out of everything yet (and you're not breaking any NDA's and rules), start downloading and putting things into a Google drive. Templates you used, tutorials, examples, etc. You can always redact information later if needed, but you can't go back and get it. This also includes a copy of your severance contract (if you were given one).\n3. **Ask for letters of recommendation / references:** immediately ask managers or directors if they'd be okay providing a recommendation. Some job postings I've seen directly ask for an uploaded letter of recommendation; others will ask for their contact information. Best to ask when you're top of mind with a good relationship so you can confidently list them on any and all your applications.\n4. **Know an employment gap won't destroy you:** this layoff was both my first layoff and also my first big kid job. I was super worried everything I worked for fell apart or was for nothing, but I talked to a lot of industry mentors and they said gaps in employment can always be explained (especially given these crazy times). They advised that I take the time to travel, do side projects, learn new skills. Anything that I didn't have the time for before and might not be able to do when I'm older.\n5. **It's not your fault:** I think that's the most important thing to remember. This is all beyond us as just agency employees. You could have taken a different role at a different agency, but next week you might see layoffs there too. We can't control it and we'll never know if we truly would have been better somewhere else, only that we have to try and steer ourselves to somewhere better in the future.\n\nI'm still on the job hunt myself, so sending a lot of good energy to those impacted today and potentially impacted in the future.", "likes_or_score": 16, "reply_count": 1, "creator_heart_or_awards": 0, "author_cred_proxy": 0, "author": "Cerullie", "source_url": "https://reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/1pbwvai/advice_to_folks_who_got_laid_off/"}

Every so often I would sit in front  of the screens and think to myself what would be if I had my own company..\n\nOne day I was at the office and said fuck it, gave my two weeks, and left. After that went to school to get the licenses it took 9 months. Once the company started operating it was just go go go, spend money to earn money.

What really sucks is that I’m essentially financing projects out of pocket, to then wait and suck up for stuff that wasn’t part of the deal so I please the clients to not only get my money back, but to get paid.\n\nAnyway the image change and ego is what I think stops me from going all in. Going from fancy offices, travelling, spending thousands at restaurants to now always surviving. I essentially have one foot in this new career and the other still in finance, every so often I think of going back. To this day I haven’t updated my LinkedIn since leaving finance because there’s something I feel embarrassed about. \n\nThe entrepreneurial life is hard, depending of your resources and how you approach it. I had to bootstrap it, and doing much more work in different fields now. The testing part is hard, the client acquisition is hard, managing people especially hard headed construction guys is hard, bitchy and demanding clients.

I closed that business during Covid because my father was my business partner which wasn’t ideal, and more importantly, we faced challenges that eventually became too difficult to overcome.\n\nSince then, I have reinvented myself and spent the last four years working in IT consulting. My mind has always worked like that of an entrepreneur. I have been thinking about starting my own business again for quite some time, but a recent and unexpected job loss has pushed me to make a decision. I am now at a point where I need to choose between returning to the job market, which I honestly find discouraging, or fully committing to building my own business again.\n\nI do not have a large amount of capital saved, and I am doing my best not to get overwhelmed by the uncertainty of where my next paycheck will come from. I understand that sacrifices will be necessary.\n\nDo you have any advice for someone in my situation? I know you have already shared your general thoughts on what it takes, but I am hoping you might have something to add that speaks more directly to my circumstances. For context, I am considering starting my own practice as a technical consultant and offering B2B consulting services to small and medium sized businesses.\n\nThank you in advance.", "likes_or_score": 1, "reply_count": 1, "creator_heart_or_awards": 0, "author_cred_proxy": 0, "author": "DustyJames3", "source_url": "https://reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1pbqs27/advice_from_a_9figure_entrepreneur/"}

And it's a toss up, is sales a more important skill, or is technical a more important skill.\n\nIt's kind of a catch-22. When sales people run companies they are able to go and sell investors, and get the money. But they don't know how to deliver.\n\nFor example, Elizabeth Holmes. She was able to go and raise the money. The product didn't work and now she's in jail.\n\nWhen technical people run the company, they can build a great product, and it can be sometimes hard to sell.\n\nThe biggest problem for technical people is getting out of speaking technical language and speaking the language of your audience.\n\nExecutives are speaking in a different high level jargon. A blue collar tradesperson is speaking a different language.\n\nGetting onto the wavelength of your customer requires a different set of emotional intelligence skills.\n\nHowever, what I've found is when you are onto something, selling becomes a heck of a lot easier.

My business has exploded in the last 3 months. I went from making $5k a month to making nearly $40k last month. It's affiliate marketing so I guess you could consider it self employment. I'm 20 years old so this has been pretty life changing for me. However I am signed up to go on a Semester at Sea, which is truly a once in a lifetime experience. On top of that I got nearly a full ride scholarship. I signed up when I was making $5k a month from the business and I was OK leaving that behind. I know I can scale more and I literally get to make that money from the comfort of my own home around the people I love. Now I am not sure if I can leave that behind, I'd have to rebuild when I get back which could be quick or take a long time. I have no way of knowing. It's a short term business that will probably last a few more years before I have to pivot into something else. Also if I went it'd be during Q1, so sales may be slightly lower but I'm confident I can maintain $20k-$40k every month.\n\nI've been trying to decide for 2 months and can't get myself to do it. I know going on the trip would be incredibly beneficial for me, but staying back could set up my future to a point where I'm confident I could retire very early, like 30 years old. If money wasn't in the equation I would obviously push myself to go. There is no way I could run the business while abroad, or have someone else successfully run it for me. Is staying back a mistake? Everyone says SAS was the best experience of their entire lives and that they'd trade all their money to go back. However I feel like I may be in a different situation. Traveling for me is 80% about the people and 20% about the location, so going solo on another trip probably wouldn't appeal to me as much.

{"platform": "reddit", "post_id": "1pliocz", "comment_id": "ntu6sre", "created_utc": "2025-12-13T16:53:16Z", "text": "Apologies ahead of time. This got longer than I originally intended, but I think a lot of people don't know a lot about the evolution of telecom capabilities.\n\ntl;dr - data technology evolution 2G -> 2.5G (GPRS) -> 2.75G (EDGE) -> 3G (UMTS) -> 3.5G (HSDPA) -> 3.75G (HSPA+) -> 4G (LTE) -> 4G-LTE Advanced (5Ge) -> 5G NR \n\nG is most likely short for 2G which means you have access to voice calls and basic data services like SMS.  After 2G came, GPRS (General Packet Radio Service  which is also known as 2.5G). Same radio spectrum, just better data speed. Better is relative here, we're talking typical speeds of 20-50kbps for GPRS, and that's painful compared to today's modern mobile data speeds.\n\nThe next data upgrade was called EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution, which is also known as 2.75G). This offers about three times the speed that GPRS provided. \n\nThe next big step was actual 3G, or UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) and was a significant upgrade from GPRS/EDGE networks. This got you to \\~384kbps speeds, which is definitely usable.  \n\nWhat rolled out was HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access, which is also known as 3.5G). However, some US carriers branded this as \"3G+\" or \"Turbo 3G\". With HSDPA you'll get around 3-5Mbps. \n\nThe next generational step is where things started to get more fuzzy, because Carrier marketing departments started getting involved, at least here in the United States. This next step up was HSPA+ (Evolved HSPA) that could get you to up to 5-8Mbps. But in the US, carriers branded this \"4G\" even though it wasn't. \n\nSo now when US carriers rolled out actual 4G LTE (Long Term Evolution), they couldn't use \"4G\" since it already been used, so they went with \"LTE\" as the marketing term.  Outside the US, for example, in the UK, carriers didn't use \"4G\" until they had actually rolled out 4G.  So while 4G is called \"LTE\" in the US, in the UK it is called \"4G\". 4G/LTE speeds are much much better, between 20-80Mbps.  \n\nIt's important to note, since the US carriers used \"4G\" before the networks we're actually migrated to LTE, that voice service was not VoLTE. If you make a call on a pre-LTE network, the radio on the phone would have to re-tune to the older 2G/3G network. This is call CSFB (Circuit Switched Fallback). The experience for the phone user would be the \"4G\" icon would become a \"3G\" icon while on a voice call. This allowed you still use data while on a call, albeit at lower speeds.\n\nAfter US carriers upgraded to real LTE, voice moved from circuit switch to Voice over LTE (aka VoLTE). This allows the phone to remain on the high speed data network while making a voice call. By avoiding the radio re-tuning, call setup times (PDD or post dial delay, think from the time you hit send on the dialpad to when you hear farend ringback) was dramatically decreased, in some cases down to fractions of a second.  Also, the speeds and low data latencies of modern LTE networks paved the way to much better voice quality.  The initial VoLTE networks supported AMR-NB (Adaptive Multirate Narrowband) which provided traditional phone quality, but then rolled out AMR-WB (wideband) which has much better clarity, sometimes marketed as \"HD Voice\" or \"Enhanced Voice\".\n\nThe next gen is 5G, with US Carrier marketing muddying the waters again. For example, AT&T upgraded 4G LTE (LTE-Advanced), which offers better speeds than their previously named \"LTE\", so they called it 5GE, short for 5G Evolution. It's not true 5G. These speeds were anywhere from 30-400Mbps, depending on network conditions, congestion, etc.\n\nActual 5G NR (New Radio), is true next-gen 5G, on a completely new standard, using new radio spectrum, with a massive jump in speeds, with ulta-low latency. We're talking 100Mbs to over 1Gbps, although because network congestion, and range limitations, in US more typical speeds are 180-300Mbps range. These speeds will allow future advanced services to actually be feasible, like real time AR (Augmented Reality), VR (Virtual Reality), and whatever future IoT (Internet of Things) devices people might come up with.", "likes_or_score": 8, "reply_count": 1, "creator_heart_or_awards": 0, "author_cred_proxy": 0, "author": "Big_Green_Grill_Bro", "source_url": "https://reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1pliocz/never_seen_this_g_in_my_life/"}

It still relies just on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Additionally, the Nearby/Quick Share still has the Android Beam vibe by putting 2 phones' backs against each other with NFC enabled, making the devices discoverable to each other even when set to private, making them quickly discoverable without having to dig through the settings.

Other consumers need to be romanced and for them you’re going to need more romantic language to encourage them to buy. The same thing goes for photos, some consumers just need the white background image with no noise, other people really need to see it on a person.

By forcefully removing interests and other targeting metrics meta is now forced to take extra steps to see what kinds of people to target your ad to (which ends up in charging the advertiser more money). \n\nThey could very easily keep targeting, train the pixel on that small set of data, and compare that with lookalike audiences to spread out the ad to other people. But with their new broad targeting mindset they now for each campaign have to start from absolute zero.\n\nIt’s like telling an agency you want to run ads in a magazine but the agency telling you you’re not allowed to tell it which magazine and then forcing you to spend a bunch of money on ads that you know won’t move your product, then the agency telling you “we need to figure out who your audience is for your men’s aftershave and so we need to advertise to EVERYONE possible before we can decide who to focus on.
